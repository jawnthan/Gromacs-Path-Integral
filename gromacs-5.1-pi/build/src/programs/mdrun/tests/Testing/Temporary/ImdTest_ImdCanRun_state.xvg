@    title "IMD Pull Forces"
@    xaxis  label "Time (ps)"
@    yaxis  label "# of Forces / Atom IDs / Forces (kJ/mol)"
# Can display and manipulate 3 (of a total of 6) atoms via IMD.
# column 1    : time (ps)
# column 2    : total number of atoms feeling an IMD pulling force at that time
# cols. 3.-6  : global atom number of pulled atom, x-force, y-force, z-force (kJ/mol)
# then follow : atom-ID, f[x], f[y], f[z] for more atoms in case the force on multiple atoms is changed simultaneously.
# Note that the force on any atom is always equal to the last value for that atom-ID found in the data.
